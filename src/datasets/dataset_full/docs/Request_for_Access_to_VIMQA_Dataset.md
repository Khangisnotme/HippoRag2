Dear Dr. Nguyen,

I am a final-year undergraduate student at Hanoi University of Science and Technology. I am writing to kindly request access to the Vietnamese Multi-hop Question Answering (VIMQA) dataset to use for my bachelor thesis research.

I have attached my signed End User License Agreement (EULA) form as required.
Below are my contact details:

Email: cuongmkmtpgoldfinch@gmail.com

I would like to assure you that I will fully cite and acknowledge the use of the VIMQA dataset in my thesis and any related publications. If I successfully graduate, I will be very happy to write a thank-you post to express my gratitude for your support.

Thank you very much for your support.
